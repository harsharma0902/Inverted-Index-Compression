# Inverted-Index-Search-Engine
The IMPLEMENTATION is mainly based on designing a SEARCH ENGINE taking into consideration the Compression Technologies. I have used the most effective Compression Technology to enhance the Query Processing Speed to the maximum extent. A Search Engine is a Combination of a Series of Steps which are needed to be performed. I have divided these as separate sections for Easier Organisation and Effective Implementation.  SOFTWARES USED FOR IMPLEMENTATION- (A) PYTHON: THE CODE IS WRITTEN IN PYTHON. IT IS USED MAINLY BECAUSE OF ITS RICH LIBRARY AND ABILITY TO PERFORM COMPLEX ALGORITHMS. IT MAKES Natural Language Processing (NLP) EASIER TO PERFORM.  (B) MongoDB: IT IS USED FOR STORING THE INVERTED INDEX INTO THE DATABASE. THIS WAY IT CAN BE ACCESSED BY THE Query() FUNCTION AT ANY TIME. THIS ENSURES THAT THE INDEX DOESNâ€™T HAVE TO FORMED AGAIN AND AGAIN.  (C) Qt: IT IS USED FOR DESIGNING THE UI FOR THE SEARCH ENGINE. THE FINAL INTERFACE LOOKS LIKE THIS USING Qt.
